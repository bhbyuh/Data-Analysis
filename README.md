# Netflix Data Analysis with Pandas

This repository contains a project focused on analyzing Netflix data using **Pandas** for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating insightful visualizations to understand trends and patterns in the dataset.

## Features
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - Detailed statistical summary of the dataset.
   - Identification of missing data and handling techniques.

2. **Data Visualizations**:
   - Interactive and static plots to visualize trends in Netflix data.
   - Insights into popular genres, trends over time, ratings, and more.

3. **Insights**:
   - Uncover patterns in content creation and user preferences.
   - Analyze relationships between various features such as release year, rating, and duration.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For running and documenting the analysis.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains information about Netflix shows and movies, including:
  - Title, Genre, Release Year, Rating, Cast, Director, Duration, Country, and Description.
- You can download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) or use your own.

## Workflow
1. **Data Loading**:
   - Load the Netflix dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Convert data types where necessary (e.g., date parsing).

3. **EDA**:
   - Explore key metrics such as the number of titles by year, genre distribution, and country-wise content.
   - Identify trends in ratings and duration.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - Create bar plots, line charts, histograms, and heatmaps to visualize patterns in the data.
   - Showcase interactive visualizations for deeper exploration.
